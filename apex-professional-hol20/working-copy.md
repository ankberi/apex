# Create a Working Copy to Merge, Refresh, or Compare

## Introduction

A Working Copy enables developers to create a special copy of an application, make changes in the copy, and then merge those changes back into the main development application (or Main application). Similarly, you can also merge changes from the Main application back into the Working Copy. During the export process, you can view a comparison (or diff) of the Working Copy and the Main application and then select which changes to merge.

A common use case for this feature is when you want to test some changes on a page first and then merge them back into the Main application later.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Working Copy of an Application.

- Merge and Refresh changes from a Working Copy into the Main application.

### Downloads

- Did you miss out on trying the previous labs? Donâ€™t worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/demo-projects-5.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.

## Task 1: Create a Working Copy of an Application

1. On the Workspace home page, click the **App Builder** icon and select **Demo Projects** application.

2. On the Application home page, find **Working Copy Tasks** on the side bar.

3. Under **Working Copy Tasks**, click **Create Working Copy**.

4. On Create Working Copy page, enter/select the following:

    - Working Copy Name: **Dev**

    Click **Create Working Copy**.

5. When viewing a Working Copy on the Application Home page, the Working Copy Name displays next to the application name and a Working Copy: Name menu displays on the menu bar between Shared Components and Edit Page.

    - Options on the Working Copy: Name menu include:

        - **Switch to Main** - Links to the Main application.

        - **Working Copies** - Displays links to existing working copies.

        - **Merge into Main** - Merge changes from the Working Copy into the Main application.

        - **Refresh Working Copy** - Import changes from the Main application into the Working Copy.

        - **Compare Changes** - Compare changes between the Working Copy and Main application.

        - **View Working Copy Details** - View or edit the Working Copy Name or Description.

        - **Delete Working Copy** - Delete the current Working Copy.

    - The side bar on Application home page features links to these commonly uses options:

        - **Working Copy Tasks**:

            - Merge to Main

            - Refresh Working Copy

            - Compare Changes

        - **Main Application** - Include a link to the Main application.

## Task 2: Compare Changes between a Working Copy and Main

1. To compare changes between a Working Copy and the Main Application, let's make changes in the Demo Projects application.

2. Navigate to **Demo Projects** applications, select **Shared Components**.
