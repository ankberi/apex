# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code - without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser.

This hands-on labs will guide you through the process of creating applications, whether based on existing database tables or starting from spreadsheet data. By following step-by-step instructions, youâ€™ll gain practical knowledge of Oracle APEX's powerful features and capabilities.

These labs emphasize the importance of building functional and secure applications while introducing you to key features such as dashboards, interactive reports, Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality, access controls, and application blueprints.

### Recap

In the preceding workshop, you gained knowledge on installing sample tables. You acquired skills in appending new columns to pre-existing tables, filling the new columns with data, and generating lookup tables. Additionally, you were assigned the task of crafting a package. Finally, you mastered creating database objects through Quick SQL, loading data with the Data Generator, and employing the Data Workshop page for data loading.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Create database applications using existing tables and spreadsheets.

- Build dashboards, reports, and interactive pages to visualize and manage data.

- Implement administration pages with secure access control for authorized users.

- Enable Progressive Web App (PWA) features for enhanced user experience.

- Learn to restore applications using blueprints for easy customization and recovery.

- Explore the structure and functionality of completed applications.

> **Note:** This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.2.
