# Improve Classic Report

## Introduction

In this task, you will learn how to enhance a Classic Report in an Oracle APEX application by modifying its attributes and incorporating dynamic elements. Classic Reports are a powerful way to display data in a structured format, and by customizing the report, you can create an intuitive and interactive user experience. Specifically, we will enhance the Manage Products page within the Online Shopping Application by updating the SQL query, modifying column attributes, and configuring links and buttons.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Customize the Classic Report to enhance its presentation and functionality.

- Implement a Download BLOB feature for the PRODUCT_DETAILS column.

- Configure the PRODUCT_IMAGE column to display images directly within the report.

- Modify the SQL query to fetch additional product-related data (color, department, clothing).

- Adjust column settings, such as setting PRODUCT_ID as a clickable link.

### Downloads

- Did you miss out on trying the previous labs? Donâ€™t worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/hol10.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.
