[](youtube:6pKNt_FXP7g)

In this workshop, you'll create a Shopping Cart application that allows managing products, customers, and  stores. The application will have two application roles:

- Administrators:

    - To manage the products, customers and stores.

    - To access a dashboard to identify the top products.

- Customers:

    - To review, add, delete, or edit the number of products in the shopping cart.

    - To submit orders.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2.5 hours

### **Let's Get Started!**

- If the menu is not displayed, you can open by clicking the menu button (![Menu icon](./images/menu-button.png)) at the top-left of the page.

### Downloads

- If you are stuck or the application is not working as expected, you can download and install the completed App as follows:

    1. First, install the sample dataset from your workspace using the following lab: **[Using SQL Workshop > Lab 1: Install Sample Tables](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524&p210_wec=&session=8379360721545)**

    2. After installing the sample dataset tables, download the SQL script from **[here](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles%2FOnlineShoppingApp-PartialDDLs.sql)**. If you have already created the database objects, you can skip this step.

        To import the SQL script follow the below steps:

        - Navigate to your APEX homepage, click the down arrow next to **SQL Workshop**, and select **SQL Scripts**.

        ![Workspace home page](./images/click-sqlscript.png " ")

        - Click **Upload** and drag and drop the SQL script file downloaded in the previous step.

        ![Workspace home page](./images/click-upload.png " ")

        - After uploading, click the **Run** icon.

        ![Workspace home page](./images/run-script.png " ")

        ![Workspace home page](./images/partial-ddl-success.png " ")

    3. Now, **[Click here](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles%2Foic-library_acme-shop.sql)** to download the completed application and import it into your workspace.

    4. When you run the application, you may encounter an “unauthorized user” error because no user has been assigned to the authorization scheme yet. To fix this, go to **Shared Components** in your workspace. Under Security, select **Application Access Control**, and click **Add User Role Assignment**. Then, add the username you wish to log in to the application, choose the appropriate application role, and click **Create Assignment**.

        ![Workspace home page](./images/role-assignment.png " ")

        ![Workspace home page](./images/add-user.png " ")

    5. Follow **LAB 9** to configure Generative AI.

    6. To use the **Vector Search** capabilities of this application, perform the steps mentioned in **LAB 10: Task 1, Task 2  and Task 3**.

> Note: If you want to reinstall the the database objects, you can download the provided **[script](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles%2FCleanup-Scripts.sql)** to drop the existing database objects.
